# Version 1.5

A small compiled language that compiles to PomScript, a small homemade set of instruction that can also be used by itself as well. The language syntax (Pom) is a intututive syntax that uses jump points and arrows to convey the flow.

## Installing

There are two ways to handle installing Pom. The recommended way to install Pom is using the [simpleinstall.py](https://github.com/MaceroniMan/Pom/blob/master/simpleinstall.py) script. This script will download and install all the required components just by running it. It will also function as a updater. (This means that if you run it again it will install all the new code)

However if you like to see what you are installing, use this [link](https://github.com/MaceroniMan/Pom/wiki#installing) to visit the wiki page to install Pom. Pom is installed with `pip` and also places an executable in the python executable location.

## Examples

There are some example code in the [examples](https://github.com/MaceroniMan/Pom/tree/master/examples) directory for some newcomers to try out. There is a additional `README` file in there to utilize.

## Fancy Colors

There is syntax highlighting, but for now only notepad++. Syntax highlighting is not a high priority but VS Code might be added in the future.

* Notepad++ **|** Import the `Notepad++ Syntax Highlighting.xml` file into Notepad++ and see the amazing colors
