# Version 1.5

A small compiled language that compiles to PomScript, a small homemade set of instruction that can also be used by itself as well. The language syntax (Pom) is a intututive syntax that uses jump points and arrows to convey the flow.

## Installing

To install Pom, use this [link](https://github.com/MaceroniMan/Pom/wiki#installing) to visit the wiki page on installing Pom. Pom is installed with `pip` and also places an executable in the python executable location so it can be run with a simple `pom` instead of the longer way `python(3) -m pom`, however both ways still do work.

## Examples

There are some example code in the [examples](https://github.com/MaceroniMan/Pom/tree/master/examples) directory for some newcomers to try out. There is a additional `README` file in there to utilize.

## Fancy Colors

There is syntax highlighting, but for now only notepad++. Syntax highlighting is not a high priority but VS Code might be added in the future.

* Notepad++ **|** Import the `Notepad++ Syntax Highlighting.xml` file into Notepad++ and see the amazing colors
