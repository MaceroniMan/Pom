# Version 1.3

A small compiled language that compiles to PomScript, a small homemade set of instruction that can also be used by itself as well. The language syntax (Pom) is a intututive syntax that uses jump points and arrows to convey the syntax.

## Fancy Colors

There is syntax highlighting, but for now only notepad++. Syntax highlighting is not a high priority but VS Code might be added in the future.

* Notepad++ **|** Import the `Notepad++ Syntax Highlighting.xml` file into Notepad++ and see the amazing colors

## Installing
